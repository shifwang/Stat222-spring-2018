I plan to talk about Expectation Maximization algorithm. This lab will be quite notation heavy and no coding involved. 
I will start with block coordinate descent, then majorization minimization (MM algorithm), then EM algorithm. I will talk about a toy example using EM to fit Gaussian mixture models.
